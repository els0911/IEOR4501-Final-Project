# E4501 Tools For Analytics Final-Project: Tracking Squirrel Sightings

## Background
Eccentric billionaire Joffrey Hosencratz just purchased the web development company you work for. Youâ€™ve met him once in an elevator and he was impressed with your skill in developing web applications with the Django framework. He also relayed that his most recent trip to Sedona, AZ has left him in a bit of trouble. See, he fancies the show Rick and Morty and a particular scene coupled with a traumatic childhood squirrel experience and a bad crystal bath experience in Sedona has left him wanting.
