# E4501 Tools For Analytics Final-Project: Tracking Squirrel Sightings

## Background
Eccentric billionaire Joffrey Hosencratz just purchased the web development company you work for. You’ve met him once in an elevator and he was impressed with your skill in developing web applications with the Django framework. He also relayed that his most recent trip to Sedona, AZ has left him in a bit of trouble. See, he fancies the show Rick and Morty and a particular scene coupled with a traumatic childhood squirrel experience and a bad crystal bath experience in Sedona has left him wanting.

He would like to start keeping track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park. He’s asked you to build an application that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data and allow his team to add, update, and view squirrel data. 

## Web Application Introduction

They count squirrels and present their findings to the public. This table contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.
